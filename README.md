# projectlounge
This is the source code for the Node.js backend portion of [projectlounge.pw](https://projectlounge.pw). Historically, this had more things (check the commit history), but nowadays this mainly just serves the random image APIs at [files.projectlounge.pw](https://files.projectlounge.pw) that are used mostly by [esmBot](https://esmbot.net).
